<h2>If you’re like us, you’re on the edge of your seat, waiting with bated breath to hear some juicy news about Stranger Things season 5. Understandably, season 5, the finale of Netflix’s Stranger Things, is now one of the most highly anticipated television events in history. Since Vecna succeeded in tearing open a massive gate to the Upside Down, 
   audiences now expect the heroes of Hawkins to engage in an epic final battle against the evil psychic and his army of monsters.
   At this point, details regarding the season to end all seasons have been scarce, and the world likely won’t get to see the show’s last episodes for quite a while. In the meantime, here’s everything that has been revealed and should be expected from Stranger Things 5

<h2>The main villain of Stranger Things 4.
   As season 5 is due to start production in May 2023, we’re most likely a year or more away from the release of the new content on Netflix.

Judging by the show’s history, past seasons were usually launched in the summer, so a good estimate for Stranger Things season 5 would be during the summer of 2025, from about May to July. Go ahead and mark your calendars and make sure you have no plans during those few months; we’ll wait.</h2>

<h2>Season 4 spent a lot of time introducing a variety of new characters like Eddie, Argyle, Dmitri, Yuri, Vecna, and Victor Creel, to name a few. This all contributed to the season’s extraordinarily long runtime, which many audiences took issue with.

   Fortunately, the Duffers revealed on Netflix Geeked that the fifth season will not bring in any new players to join the war for Hawkins, which will leave more time for the show to focus on the original cast and developing their characters. It will also give audiences a break from the show’s habit of introducing lovable characters and quickly killing them off. We’re likely going to see all of the originals at some point, but here’s a quick breakdown of who’s still in:</h2>
